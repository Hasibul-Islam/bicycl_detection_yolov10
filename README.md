# üö≤ Bicycle Detection using YOLOv10

This repository demonstrates how to train and deploy a **YOLOv10** object detection model for detecting **bicycles** in images and videos. The project is built using [Ultralytics YOLOv10](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) and can be adapted for real-time applications such as **traffic monitoring, smart city systems, autonomous vehicles, and surveillance**.

---

## üìå Features
- Train YOLOv10 on a **custom dataset** for bicycle detection
- Perform **real-time inference** on images, videos, and webcam streams
- Support for **exporting models** to ONNX, TensorRT, and other formats for deployment
- Lightweight and fast detection suitable for **edge devices**
